JAMBOARD
=========

OVERVIEW

This is a simple wavetable synthesizer that allows you to play a monophonic
sine wave melody using the keys on your keyboard.  The pitch ranges three
octaves from A-110 to A-880.  When the program initiates, it begins by
playing A-220, and then provides a prompt ('>> ') for commands, including
note changes.  To enter a command, type it and then hit RETURN.  The notes
of the octave you are in are organized based on the number keys of your
keyboard.  1 is the lowest A in the octave, and 8 is A one octave higher.
The numbers in-between 1 and 8 each correspond to the associated degree
of the A-min scale (e.g. 3 is the C above 1).  Notes not in the scale
are represented by the ASCII key directly below and between the number keys
that correspond to its nearest neighbors (e.g. C# is played by entering 'e').

If that is confusing, this schematic showing spatial arrangement of keys
and their associated note values may help:

-----------------KEYS---------------------- <=|=> ----------CORRESPONDING NOTES------------
                                              |
[`][1]   [2] [3]   [4]   [5] [6]   [7]   [8]  |  [g#][a]   [b] [c]   [d]   [e] [f]   [g]   [a]
      [q]       [e]   [r]       [y]   [u]     |         [a#]      [c#]  [d#]      [f#]  [g#]
                                              |

   OTHER COMMANDS:
   --------------
     -   --->  Go down an octave
     =   --->  Go up an octave (if it were '+' you would have to type shift...)
     z   --->  Print operation info to terminal
     x   --->  EXIT PROGRAM



COMPILING

When compiling, you must include an option for searching the 'portaudio'
library.  Otherwise you will get an 'undefined symbols for architecture
x86_64' error, telling you that all the PortAudio functions in the script
are undefined.  If you use the gcc, compile like this:

	gcc melodyARG.c -lportaudio -o melodyARG

To execute from the same directory, enter the following:

        ./jamboard



PORTAUDIO DEPENDENCY

It is written using the PortAudio API, so you will need to download and install
pa_stable_v19_20140130.tgz from the PortAudio website if you do not already
have it:

	http://portaudio.com/download.html

This version of PortAudio in turn depends on the Mac 10.4 SDK, which was part
of Xcode 3, but has since been superseded.  As far as I know, Apple does not
provide any legacy SDKs, so this can be hard to find.  However, if you use
Homebrew to download PortAudio you shouldn't have to worry about finding the
right SDK.



!!!WARNING!!!

Before the program terminates a 'click' sound is created in the audio stream.
Likewise, a click is created at the beginning of the next audio stream that is
initiated on your computer after the execution of this program. Clicks and other
sounds that contain high-amplitude high-frequency harmonics can damage speakers
over time.  I would not recommend playing this program through speakers that you
care very much about.  I use my computer speakers, but you should decide for
yourself what speakers/headphones to use, if you are comfortable using any at
all.
