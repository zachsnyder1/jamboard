JAMBOARD
=========

OVERVIEW

This is a wavetable synthesizer that allows you to play a melody using 
the keys on your keyboard.  The pitch ranges four octaves from A-100 to 
A-1760, and the timbre can be sine wave or a square wave.  Invoke:

                   ./jamboard c

COMMANDS

When the program initiates it provides a prompt ('>> ').  This is where you
enter all commands, including note changes.  To enter a command, type it and
then hit RETURN.

The notes of the octave you are in are organized based on the number keys of
your keyboard.  1 is the lowest A in the octave, and 8 is A one octave higher.
The numbers in-between 1 and 8 each correspond to the associated degree
of the A-min scale (e.g. 3 is the C above 1).  Notes not in the scale
are represented by the ASCII key directly below and between the number keys
that correspond to its nearest neighbors (e.g. C# is played by entering 'e').

If that is confusing, this schematic showing spatial arrangement of keys
and their associated note values may help:

---------------- KEYS: -----------------------|
                                              |
[`][1]   [2] [3]   [4]   [5] [6]   [7]   [8]  |
      [q]       [e]   [r]       [y]   [u]     |
                                              |
----------- CORRESPONDING NOTES: -------------|
                                              |
[g#][a]   [b] [c]   [d]   [e] [f]   [g]   [a] |
       [a#]      [c#]  [d#]      [f#]  [g#]   |

   OTHER COMMANDS:
   --------------
     -   --->  Go down an octave
     =   --->  Go up an octave (if it were '+' you would have to type shift...)
     A   --->  Timbre = sine wave (default)
     S   --->  Timbre = square wave
     z   --->  Print operation info to terminal
     x   --->  EXIT PROGRAM


PORTAUDIO DEPENDENCY

This program is written using the PortAudio API, so you will need to download and install
pa_stable_v19_20140130.tgz from the PortAudio website if you do not already
have it:

        http://portaudio.com/download.html

This version of PortAudio in turn depends on the Mac 10.4 SDK, which was part
of Xcode 3, but has since been superseded.  As far as I know, Apple does not
provide any legacy SDKs, so this can be hard to find.  However, if you use
Homebrew to download PortAudio you shouldn't have to worry about finding the
right SDK:

        brew install portaudio



COMPILING

When compiling, you may need to explicitly link to the 'portaudio' library.
If you use the gcc, compile like this:

	      gcc jamboard.c -lportaudio -o jamboard
