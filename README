JAMBOARD
=========

OVERVIEW

This is a simple wavetable synthesizer that allows you to play a monophonic
sine wave melody using the keys on your keyboard.  The pitch ranges five
octaves from A-55 to A-1760.  There are two modes:

   1) Continuous sine wave--
          A sine wave sounds at a fixed amplitude; you can only
          change the pitch.  This mode sounds more musical because the pitch
          can be changed quickly.  To enter this mode, execute

                   ./jamboard

          with no additional command line arguments from the directory where
          you compiled to.

   2) Envelope control--
          Attack, decay, and release are set using command line arguments.
          Notes are played sequentially, with no overlap of the envelopes
          of adjacent notes.  This makes the melody very slow and lacking
          in rhythm, but I will be expanding the capabilities of this mode.

          There are 6 additional command line arguments:
            1] 'initial' -> The initial amplitude value (as a percentage of
                         maximum possible amplitude)
            2] 'peak'    -> The peak amplitude value (as a percentage of
                         maximum possible amplitude)
            3] 'sustain' -> The sustained amplitude value (as a percentage of
                         maximum possible amplitude)
            4] 'attack'  -> Relative length of attack (values of 1-6 are
                            appropriate, where higher value = longer attack)
            5] 'decay'   -> Relative length of decay (values of 1-6 are
                            appropriate, where higher value = longer decay)
            6] 'release' -> Relative length of release (values of 1-6 are
                            appropriate, where higher value = longer release)

          Example:

             ./jamboard 0 100 30 1 1 1

COMMANDS

When the program initiates it provides a prompt ('>> ').  This is where you
enter all commands, including note changes.  To enter a command, type it and
then hit RETURN.

The notes of the octave you are in are organized based on the number keys of
your keyboard.  1 is the lowest A in the octave, and 8 is A one octave higher.
The numbers in-between 1 and 8 each correspond to the associated degree
of the A-min scale (e.g. 3 is the C above 1).  Notes not in the scale
are represented by the ASCII key directly below and between the number keys
that correspond to its nearest neighbors (e.g. C# is played by entering 'e').

If that is confusing, this schematic showing spatial arrangement of keys
and their associated note values may help:

---------------- KEYS: -----------------------|
                                              |
[`][1]   [2] [3]   [4]   [5] [6]   [7]   [8]  |
      [q]       [e]   [r]       [y]   [u]     |
                                              |
----------- CORRESPONDING NOTES: -------------|
                                              |
[g#][a]   [b] [c]   [d]   [e] [f]   [g]   [a] |
       [a#]      [c#]  [d#]      [f#]  [g#]   |

   OTHER COMMANDS:
   --------------
     -   --->  Go down an octave
     =   --->  Go up an octave (if it were '+' you would have to type shift...)
     z   --->  Print operation info to terminal
     x   --->  EXIT PROGRAM



PORTAUDIO DEPENDENCY

This program is written using the PortAudio API, so you will need to download and install
pa_stable_v19_20140130.tgz from the PortAudio website if you do not already
have it:

        http://portaudio.com/download.html

This version of PortAudio in turn depends on the Mac 10.4 SDK, which was part
of Xcode 3, but has since been superseded.  As far as I know, Apple does not
provide any legacy SDKs, so this can be hard to find.  However, if you use
Homebrew to download PortAudio you shouldn't have to worry about finding the
right SDK.



COMPILING

When compiling, you must include an option for searching the 'portaudio'
library.  Otherwise you will get an 'undefined symbols for architecture
x86_64' error, telling you that all the PortAudio functions in the script
are undefined.  If you use the gcc, compile like this:

	      gcc melodyARG.c -lportaudio -o melodyARG
